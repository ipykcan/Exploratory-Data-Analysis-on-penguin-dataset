🐧 **Penguin Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**


📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Palmer Penguins dataset, a popular alternative to the Iris dataset. The dataset contains physical measurements for three penguin species observed in Antarctica. The goal of this analysis is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualize patterns, and identify key insights about species distribution and characteristics.
